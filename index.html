                        TOI-YLP attempts to mirror every aspect to you: directing and 
                        leading you to the root, motivating you to work upon a quick 
                        response to urgent problems. <br>
                        YLP exists for the youth to act in unison with an aim to 
                        create an impact by addressing social, political, and environmental
                        issues. It makes them; the youth realize the significance of
                        a youth-led nation.<br>
                        In very straightforward terms, ‘Think of It’ i.e. the ongoing 
                        issues pertaining to multifarious spheres, morality, ideals, the 
                        sense of justice that prevails and to conjecture upon ideas that 
                        should be prevailing instead. Youth and leadership share an intrinsic 
                        yet undervalued relationship, we are here to bridge the gap between the 
                        two and provide a platform to equip the leaders of tomorrow.<br>
